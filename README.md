# Pipeline CRM Homework Assignment
The goal of this Ruby on Rails & React homework assignment is to assess your ability to resolve issues and implement new functionality in a scalable and simple manner while utilizing best practices within each domain.

This repository mocks a CRM in the simplest of terms by demonstrating the one to many relationship of Companies to Deals and visualizng various attributes of each to our users.

Unfortunately, the current implementation is (intentionally) naive and not working as expected in several ways.  

Your primary task with this homework assignment is to resolve the user stories below.

## Expected Level of Investment
*Estimated time to completion: 3-4 hours*

## User Stories
- [x] The frontend is not properly fetching data, i.e. filters aren't being sent, requests are being sent too often, non-successful response codes aren't being handled, etc.
- [x] The backend is taking too long to return the expected data, i.e.  filters aren't being applied, too much data is being returned, db performance isn't optimized, etc.
- [x] The confidence in our current functionality and ability to deploy additional changes is extremely low.  Help us increase our confidence in an automated way.
- [x] The confidence in our security posture is also very low.  Help us increase our confidence that we are running a securely designed application.

## Assumptions

Assumptions to make regarding the user story for this service:

- The service is not write-intensive, but is read-intensive.
- The seed data is quite minimal. Assume the production system could have thousands (or millions) of records.

## Instructions
#### Installation & Running the App
- `sudo docker compose build`
- `sudo docker compose up`

#### Submission
- Clone the repository
- Setup a new repository with the source code
- Implement solution
- Push your solution to a new branch
- Create a Pull Request within the new repository
- When you're ready, share a link to the Pull Request with us 
 

## FAQ
#### How will I be evaluated?

Some of the things we will look at in our evaluation:
- **Functional correctness** - Does the solution function correctly and meet the requirements of the User Stories.
- **Code quality** - How you reason about making sure code is readable and maintainable.
- **Testing** - How you reason about what to test and how to test it.
- **Performance** - How you can identify performance bottlenecks and reason around solving them.
- **System design** - How you reason about concepts like reusability, separation of concerns and various abstractions.

In this we also try to understand how you solve problems generally and how you communicate your solutions. Problem solving and communication are both things we value highly.

Finally, we encourage candidates to focus on quality over quantity. Feel free to add notes/comments/etc highlighting what you would expand or improve given more time.

#### Why did you pick this stack?
This is the stack that the majority of our platform is written in.

#### Can I change things in the existing code?
Of course! The existing code is simply to serve as a simple foundation.  Feel free to modify in any way you prefer.

#### Can I use additional libraries/frameworks?
You're free to use whatever you want. The important thing is that you can explain why you made the decision.
